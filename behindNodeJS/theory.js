 * * * * * Introduction to npm :-
 * 
 * 
        1.) npm is a popular package manager which comes bundled with Node.js.
        
        2.) It is a CLI tool used to install, update, and remove external packages.

        3.)You can also create your own package and publish it on npmjs.com registry.

        4.) Do not confuse npm CLI with npmjs.com, as it’s a registry where most of the 
            packages of Node.js are saved.
            • There are alternative Node.js package managers registry like JSR, which we will discuss in future.
        5.) Fun facts:-
                • npm shouldn’t be written in capitalized form unless you have everything as capital.
                • npm doesn’t stand for Node Package Manager even though many people refer to it as 
                  that. It is a recursive bacronymic abbreviation for "npm is not an acronym“.
